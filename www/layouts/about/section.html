            Since 2001, MIT OpenCourseWare has shared Open Educational Resources
            (OER) from MIT, creating new opportunities for millions of learners
            and educators, and helping launch a global revolution in free access
            to knowledge.
            <br />
            <br />
            MIT OpenCourseWare continues to build on this foundation. With a new
            web platform, ever-growing content, and collaborations across the
            vibrant open education ecosystem, we're creating a world of more
            equitable and inclusive education for all.
