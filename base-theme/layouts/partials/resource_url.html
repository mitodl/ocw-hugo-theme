  Here we are disassembling the URL and returning it without the host and schema.

  qualified S3 URLs, and when deployed these will need to be behind CDN.

  For temporarily backward compatability with ocw-to-hugo converted content, we check
  file_location as well as file.

  The RESOURCE_BASE_URL env variable is prefixed before the URL. That way for local
  development, you can set this to the S3 URL you expect the resources to be available at.
