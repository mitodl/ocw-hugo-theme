<!-- 
  It may seem unintuitive to look explicitly for "unexpected EOF" here. Unfortunately while 
  Hugo supports setting "method" "head" to perform a HEAD request, it doesn't support checking 
  the response headers. If we just perform a normal GET here the entire ZIP file will be 
  downloaded during the build which could vastly balloon the build time or make the build fail.

  A 404 on the OCW site returns an empty body with a 404 status code, which Hugo properly 
  interprets as nil. In this case the "unexpected EOF" means "I found a file and got a 200 
  in the response, but the file was empty."
  
  The file is empty because we only made a HEAD request.
