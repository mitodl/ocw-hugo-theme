## Themes

### base-theme

The base theme should be inherited first whenever using any of the other themes.  It includes the webpack configuration for building the CSS / JS used by all the themes as well as the base layouts that include the built assets.  Anything that is to be used by all other themes should be placed here.

### course

The course theme is used to render OCW course sites.  Content is generated by [`ocw-studio`](https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-studio) and the structure is defined in [`ocw-hugo-projects`](https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-hugo-projects/blob/main/ocw-course/ocw-studio.yaml).  The main components are "pages" and "resources."  Course sites can be edited in an instance of `ocw-studio` and published to a backend like Github as Hugo markdown content that can be built using the course theme.

### www
![OCW Home Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12089658/137997162-ab717049-a516-479e-b567-a82a7135e65e.png)

The www theme is primarily responsible for rendering the OCW home page, although there are a few other types of content it is set up to handle including instructors that are rendered in a static JSON API, testimonials and the promotions seen in the carousel.  This content can be edited in an instance of [`ocw-studio`](https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-studio) and it uses the `ocw-www` starter configuration in [`ocw-hugo-projects`](https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-hugo-projects/blob/main/ocw-www/ocw-studio.yaml).

## Local development

### Dependencies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

If you're running the site for the first time, or if dependencies have changed, install dependencies with:

`yarn install`

### Obtaining content

Content for the themes in this repo can be generated using an instance of [`ocw-studio`](https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-studio), a CMS used to author OCW sites.  The RC instance is located at https://ocw-studio-rc.odl.mit.edu.  Its content is published to MIT's Github Enterprise instance under the [`ocw-content-rc`](https://github.mit.edu/ocw-content-rc) organization.  For the `www` theme, content can be found in the [`ocw-www`](https://github.mit.edu/ocw-content-rc/ocw-www) repo.  For the `course` theme, use any other repo in the [`ocw-content-rc`](https://github.mit.edu/ocw-content-rc) organization or create and publish your own.

### Environment variables

An example environment file can be found at `.env.example`.  To futher explain the various environment variables and what they do:

| Variable | Relevant Themes | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GTM_ACCOUNT_ID` | `base-theme`, `www`, `course` | N/A | A string representing a Google account ID to initialize Google Tag Manager with |
| `SEARCH_API_URL` | `www` | `http://discussions-rc.odl.mit.edu/api/v0/search/` | A URL to an `open-discussions` search API to fetch results from |
| `OCW_STUDIO_BASE_URL` | `www` | `http://ocw-studio-rc.odl.mit.edu/` | A URL of an instance of [`ocw-studio`](https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-studio) to fetch home page content from |
| `STATIC_API_BASE_URL` | `course` | `http://ocwnext.odl.mit.edu/` | A URL of a deployed Hugo site with a static JSON API to query against |
| `RESOURCE_BASE_URL` | `base-theme` | `https://open-learning-course-data-rc.s3.amazonaws.com/` | A base URL to prefix the rendered path to resources with |
| `WWW_HUGO_CONFIG_PATH` | `www` | `/path/to/ocw-hugo-projects/ocw-www/config.yaml` | A path to the `ocw-www` Hugo configuration file |
| `COURSE_HUGO_CONFIG_PATH` | `course` | `/path/to/ocw-hugo-projects/ocw-course/config.yaml` | A path to the `ocw-course` Hugo configuration file |
| `WWW_CONTENT_PATH` | `www` | `/path/to/ocw-content-rc/ocw-www` | A path to a Hugo site that will be rendered when running `npm run start:www` |
| `COURSE_CONTENT_PATH` | `course` | `/path/to/ocw-content-rc/` | A path to a base folder containing `ocw-course` type Hugo sites |
| `OCW_TEST_COURSE` | `course` | `18.06-spring-2010` | The name of a folder in `COURSE_CONTENT_PATH` containing a Hugo site that will be rendered when running `npm run start:course` |
| `OCW_IMPORT_STARTER_SLUG` | `www` | `ocw-course` | When generating "New Courses" cards on the home page, the `ocw-studio` API is queried using `OCW_STUDIO_BASE_URL`.  This value determines the `type` used in the query string against the API |
| `COURSE_BASE_URL` | N/A | `http://localhost:3000/courses` | Used in `build_all_courses.sh`, this is the `--baseUrl` argument passed to each course build iterated by the script |
| `VERBOSE` | N/A | `0` | Used in `build_all_courses.sh`, if set to `1` this will print verbose output from the course builds to the console |
| `DOWNLOAD` | N/A | `1` | Used in `npm run start:course`, if set to `0` this will not download course data from S3 and instead source `OCW_TEST_COURSE` from the specified `OCW_TO_HUGO_OUTPUT_DIR`. If not specified, it will default to 1 and try to download data from S3. |

### Running ocw-www

To run `ocw-www` locally for working on the `www` theme:

 - Clone the `ocw-www` content repo: https://github.mit.edu/ocw-content-rc/ocw-www
 - Clone `ocw-hugo-projects` to obtain the relevant configuration file: https://github.com/mitocw/ocw-hugo-projects
 - Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file, replacing `/path/to` with your path to the repos indicated:
   - `WWW_HUGO_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/ocw-hugo-projects/ocw-www/config.yaml`
   - `WWW_CONTENT_PATH=/path/to/ocw-content-rc/ocw-www/`
 - Optionally set these environment variables as well, depending on the functionality you need to work on:
   - `SEARCH_API_URL=https://discussions-rc.odl.mit.edu/api/v0/search/` (for testing search functionality)
   - `OCW_STUDIO_BASE_URL=http://ocw-studio-rc.odl.mit.edu/` (for testing `ocw-studio` API functionality, such as the "new courses" section rendered by `www/layouts/partials/home_course_cards.html`)
   - `RESOURCE_BASE_URL=https://open-learning-course-data-rc.s3.amazonaws.com/` (if you need to test the loading of resources from S3 or some other CDN)
 - Start the site with `npm run start:www`
 - The site should be available at http://localhost:3000/

### Running a course site

To run a course site locally for working on the `course` theme:

 - Create a course site at https://ocw-studio-rc.odl.mit.edu/sites/ using the `ocw-course` starter
 - Add content and resources to your site relevant to what you're working on and publish your site to staging
 - Find your site at https://github.mit.edu/ocw-content-rc/ and clone it locally (it's recommended to have a parent folder locally for all cloned courses, in this case `ocw-content-rc`)
 - Clone `ocw-hugo-projects` to obtain the relevant configuration file: https://github.com/mitocw/ocw-hugo-projects
 - Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file, replacing `/path/to` with your path to the repos indicated and `your-course-slug` with the folder your course was cloned into in a previous step:
   - `COURSE_HUGO_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/ocw-hugo-projects/ocw-course/config.yaml`
   - `COURSE_CONTENT_PATH=/path/to/ocw-content-rc/`
   - `OCW_TEST_COURSE=your-course-slug`
 - Optionally set these environment variables as well, depending on the functionality you need to work on:
   - `RESOURCE_BASE_URL=https://ocw-content-draft-qa.s3.amazonaws.com/` (if you need to test the loading of resources from S3 or some other CDN)
   - `STATIC_API_BASE_URL=https://ocw-draft-qa.global.ssl.fastly.net/` (for loading content from a static API like the instructors published by `ocw-www`)
 - Start the site with `npm run start:course`
 - The site should be available at http://localhost:3000/

### External API's

The `www` theme accesses external API's made available by [`ocw-studio`](https://github.com/mitodl/ocw-studio) and [`open-discussions`](https://github.com/mitodl/open-discussions) for some functionality.  Search results are provided by `open-discusisons` and `ocw-studio` provides some content for the home page, such as newly added courses and news items.  If you need to work with this functionality you can either run a local instance of either of these projects, or alternatively point at the RC instances and temporarily disable CORS in your browser.

### CORS

The search page at `/search` uses the `open-discussions` search API to source results.  Running this locally and populating it with results can be tedious, so it's often easier to just point your local website at an already running version of the search API.  In order for this to work properly, you will need to disable CORS.  This is a generally unsafe thing to do and you should make sure that in whatever browser you open with CORS disabled, you are only testing your local `ocw-www` site and not visiting other sites.  Here is a link that shows how to do this in various browsers: https://medium.com/swlh/avoiding-cors-errors-on-localhost-in-2020-5a656ed8cefa
